                <p>rEminiScenCe, Op.6 is a set of 8 pieces composed by IcyAlmondEarth between June 2022 and December 2023, released on 2 January 2025 which was the same date of the first day I started my dormitory life 3 years prior. It was released as a reminiscence to my high school times. The name highlights E-S-C, which is the abbreviation of my high school program, Engineering-Science Classroom. The set contains 2 piano solo pieces, 3 full orchestra pieces, and 3 pieces for piano and orchestra. The order of the piece was intentionally arranged by me with the help and suggestions of my high school friends.</p>
                <p>I got the idea of making this opus from thinking about growing up actually. It was my friend's birthday at the start of November 2024 when I realized that my birthday was also coming up soon. On my 17th birthday, I had a cover. On my 18th, I had my Ballade Op.4. I thought that I might should release something for my 19th birthday. Well, I initially had this thought in my mind of having Op.6 to be a kind of throwback to high school like what Op.1 is. I guess it's time for that, so I gathered pieces which I found relatable, rearranged some of them, and “Opus 6 : rEmeniScenCe” was born, thanks to my friend's birthday that started it all.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, my laptop's SSD decided to self-destruct on 7 January 2025 and all the midi files are gone, so I won't be releasing any full orchestral scores of this set because it would be too much work for me to transcribe all of it again. However, the sheet music for piano solo reduction will be available as it doesn't require that much of energy to do so.</p>

                    <p>"Prelude" in C major was composed by IcyAlmondEarth on 21 June 2022, finished and finalized in November 2024, marked "Composition No.38/94a". It's one of the first pieces that I composed at my dormitory.</p>
                    <p>I started it as a piece in C major capturing my new lifestyle and social life at my high school after the Covid-19 pandemic had softened. It was unfortunately left unfinished. It was after the piece gathering when I decided to pick up this piece and did some revision into a small prelude to be the introduction of the set.</p>
                    <p>The piece starts with an arpeggio of likely to be a decorated F major chord, reaching up a high expanded Fmaj11. The main theme then starts in 3 different octaves. The beginning chord comes back before leading to the closing of the piece. The piece ends with 3 chords, which the notes at the top are E, E-flat (Es/S), and C; ESC.</p>

                    <p>Scherzo in G major, “Morning Scherzo”, was composed by IcyAlmondEarth on 19 December 2023, marked "Composition No.79". It was the last piece I composed in 2023 and the second last piece during my high school times (before the Sunflower Waltz).</p>
                    <p>The melody appeared in my head while I was taking a bath at my dormitory. I was in a pretty rush so I memorized it. I later wrote it down when I was in the morning assemble and composed the rest of it using my classroom’s projector after the first class. My mood was pretty bright and the winter atmosphere was pretty nice, so those went into the piece. With the fun and fast tempo of 260 bpm, I termed the piece “Scherzo”. I originally composed it as a piano solo piece, but on Christmas that year, I decided to orchestrate it. My opinion on this piece is it’s pretty cute.</p>
                    <p>The piece contains 3 main sections making up a ternary form A-B-A in 3/4 time signature. The A section starts with a short introduction of scales rising up and returning back down to enter the main theme. The A section itself is also in a ternary form. The theme begins with strings playing the motif, which later is accompanied by woodwinds. The middle part of the A section has the flutes playing the melody paralleling the violins with pizzicati as the accompaniment, which in my opinion creates that cute feeling. I love this part. Then the first theme comes back joined with the brass, being more majestic, leading to the closing of the section played by trombones. The section ends with G major pizzicato chords. The B section is in C major, the sub-dominant key, slightly slower than the A section with the strings and woodwinds carrying the melody and the brass supporting. The A section repeats, exactly the same except the final G major chords. The piece ends with powerful G major chords with all instruments being played instead of the quiet pizzicati.</p>

                    <p>March in B-flat major, "March for Kebtang", was composed by IcyAlmondEarth at midnight of 3 October 2023, marked "Composition No.76". It is dedicated to my "Kebtang" friend group in my high school class. The piece includes references to the school and what my group likes to do.</p>
                    <p>Night thoughts are indeed powerful. I came up with this piece after I went to sleep. A melody came up in my mind so I drafted a few bars at midnight and later completed the piece as a piano solo march. Well, it was already the last semester of high school at that time so I wanted to compose something for my friend group. I came up with a fast and fun theme and added some references like the Rickroll and the KMUTT theme that was turned on every morning before the morning assemble. It remained as a piano solo piece for a year until the piece gathering in November 2024. I started orchestrating this piece on the exact same day that I got the idea for the opus. Unfortunately, the midi of the orchestrated version disappeared during the SSD destruction incident, so there are only the audio and the sheet of the piano solo version left.</p>
                    <p>The piece contains 3 main sections making up a ternary form A-B-A in 2/4 time signature. The A section is also in ternary form starting with 8 bars of introduction with triumphant chords and continuing with the main theme played by strings. After one repetition, the melody is passed to the woodwinds section in the middle theme which also contains 2 bars of rickroll. The first theme comes back again joined with brass. The B section acts like the trio of the march in E-flat major with woodwinds carrying the unison melody accompanied with string pizicati. The start of the section contains 2 bars of KMUTT theme. Brass then joins in the later half of the section, ending with soft pizzicati E-flat major chords before returning back to the exactly the same entire A section just without the first theme repeat.</p>

                    <p>Waltz in E-flat major, "Departure Waltz", was composed by IcyAlmondEarth on 21 February 2023, marked "Composition No.58/96b". It was originally composed as Waltz in F major for piano solo, being the 18th waltz I composed.</p>
                    <p>In February 2023, after my seniors' graduation event, I realized that it would be my time to graduate soon. I came up with this waltz for my seniors but it was unfortunately left unfinished at the middle of the second theme. The original 2023 version was in F major. It was the piece gathering again that I decided to complete this waltz, change it into E flat major, and orchestrate it. I guess this one is my up to date of release the best orchestration I did in my opinion, but sadly this one is also gone due to the SSD destruction.</p>
                    <p>The piece contains 5 sections making up a small rondo form of A-B-A-C-A in 3/4 waltz rhythm. The A theme starts with the clarinet as the melody with string accompaniments and repeats with more instruments building up to the B theme. Strings joins with the melody in the more majestic B theme and returns to the A theme with mixed intensity between the first and second repetition and continues to the C theme with pizzicato and woodwinds as the melody. The final A theme comes back with a thinner sound of only woodwinds and cello pizzicato. The piece ends with long chords leading to the final minor plagal cadence.</p>

                    <p>"Monday Rain" was an impromptu improvised by IcyAlmondEarth on 12 June 2023, marked "Composition No.67". It was the 16th Impromptu I have recorded.</p>
                    <p>On Monday 12th June 2023, it rained on my way back to dorm from my school building. Luckily, I had my umbrella with me and the rain wasn't that heavy, so I was pretty chill walking back. After arriving, the atmosphere was nice and calming, so I turned on my piano, press record, and did some improvising. My improvising style is more in the new age side than classical or romantic. At first, the recording was just left there in my iPad without anyone touching it until the piece gathering that I thought I wanted to also include it.</p>
                    <p>The piece is for piano solo, having 2 main themes alternating with each other in 4/4 time signature; each time differs a little. It was an improvisation so the structure is pretty simple. The increasing octaves of repeating A notes represents little raindrops. The piece also has chords and structure similar to my Op.3 No.3 but a lot more simple.</p>

                    <p>"In Field" was composed by IcyAlmondEarth on 27 May 2023, marked "Composition No.65", dedicated to my small band "Music in Field". It is my first piece to be mixed with guitars and drums.</p>
                    <p>During high school, I usually gathered with my friends and play music in the field in front of our dorm and sometimes performed in school concerts. It was only a year left in high school and I wanted to compose something for us, so "In Field" was born. This piece was inspired by one of the members' certain period of time with another member's guidance and suggestions in mixing. I originally completed it as a piano solo piece in June 2023 and later mixed it in July, having Yuika's Sukidakara as the main inspiration (though often mistakenly thought as Radwimps' Sparkle) and Yuika's Koidorobou as structural reference. It was also the first piece that made me believe that I can really make a band mixed songs.</p>
                    <p>The piece has a structure similar to pop songs without repetitions in 4/4 time signature, starting the first theme as the introduction verse played by flute with piano as the accompaniment. The piece continues with an instrumental intro with piano and guitar before entering the first verse with a more developed first theme played by guitar. The pre-chorus is played by piano where flutes joins in the accompaniment, leading to the chorus where strings and drums join. The piece ends with the same chord progression as the beginning with flute, guitar and piano.</p>

                    <p>“Mahon Concerto” in E major, a.k.a. POSN concertante on the theme of Mahon by xthegicx for piano and orchestra without brass, was composed (partially/arranged) by IcyAlmondEarth in March 2023, marked "Composition No.60a" (initially unnumbered). The piece was made during my time at the Computer Olympiad training camp, where I had no piano to play, between 20 March and 5 April 2023. It is also my first piece to be composed for piano and orchestra. I first published it on my Youtube channel on 14 October 2023.</p>
                    <p>The original Mahon is a heart-broken song written by xthegicx, my high school senior, back in 2021 originally in 4/4 A major (not 6/8 E major like the piece). She sent us, Music in Field, the song’s recording in late 2022; all of us somehow have our own versions of the song. This orchestrated version was born out of my laziness from actually practicing programming for the training camp and my will to play the piano, as I didn’t have my piano with me. In the evening after the camp session, I would sit in front of my laptop with my headphones on and writing midi notes, part to part, section to section, and kind of finished it in one week. I even wrote a cadenza section (a pretty difficult and might be unplayable one) for the piece. The reason I didn’t include brass instruments in the orchestration was because I didn’t know how to use them at that time.</p>
                    <p>The structure of the piece is similar to the sonata-allegro form without key changing and the first theme in the recapitulation. The piece begins with an introduction played by woodwinds as the melody and strings as the harmony. The piano then plays the first main melody section joined with some pizzicati. Then the piece goes through a short transition and arrives at the second theme which was played twice; first by the strings with the piano and other parts as accompaniment, second by the piano solo. After the exposition (I suppose), there is an orchestral transition with the melody slightly different from the first theme before arriving to the cadenza (development). The cadenza I wrote for piano solo starts with the mix of the first and second theme, moving to a new theme and quick arpeggios and scales. The transition returns, but is played by piano solo at the high register. Then the orchestra joins back for the return of the second theme (recapitulation), majestically. The orchestral transition plays again omitting some measures. The piece ends with a soft coda played by piano.</p>

                    <p>"Rainbow-colored Evening Sky" was composed by IcyAlmondEarth on 19 August 2022, marked "Composition No.40". It was originally composed as a piano solo piece and released as Op.3 No.6 in 2023, but I selected this piece again in the piece gathering and orchestrated it in November 2024, marked "Composition No.40/96a".</p>
                    <p>Back in August 2022, I went for a walk around the campus after dinner under the rainbow-colored evening sky after the rain. I took that as the inspiration and composed this piece for piano solo. It is still one of my favorite pieces I have composed. After I got some more orchestration skills, I decided to pick up this piece again in the piece gathering, feeling that I can improve this piece, being one of my favorite, even further with orchestration, capturing the atmosphere and feeling of what I wanted it to sound like when I first composed the piece. Now I am very happy with the orchestration, even though the midi file was gone with my laptop SSD.</p>
                    <p>The structure of this piece isn't very clear, containing the intro, the first theme, the second theme, and the coda in 4/4 time signature. The piece introduced with the A theme in the introduction with long chords, with horns handling the melody. The A theme is played again with strings in the first theme in a more moving manner, from 8th notes accompaniments, linked with a piano transition, to a more developed A theme with more instruments and 8th notes triplets accompaniment. The piece then moves to the second theme with piano playing repeating 4 notes in triplets throughout the theme, strings and flute playing the accompaniment, and horns playing the main melody. The piece continues with a short simple cadenza-like piano solo before leading to the coda with the restatement of the A theme, ending with high piano grace note just like the piano solo version.</p>
                    <p>The set ends with a final look back to my teenage life, moving on with adulthood.</p>
