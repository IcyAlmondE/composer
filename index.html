            <h1 class="sec-head">Composition Numbering System</h1>
            <div class="yap">
                <p>When you start to have a lot of compositions, a numbering system comes in handy for indication. I have set up my own numbering system "Composition No." or "C.", as simple as it is, since the start of my second composition. Not because I saw myself in the future composing a lot, but I thought it would be cool. To be honest, seeing numbers in classical compositions kinda make it cooler at least a bit. I also thought of just using the Opus numbers, but I changed my mind and decided to save those for releases of compositions that are good enough (according to my evaluation of course).</p>
                <p>Some of my compositions also have letters or slash numbers after the composition number. The letters tell the point of time between the neighboring compositions that the piece was composed in case I forgot or did not assign a composition number. It is also associated with the slash numbers. For example, C.36a is a piece that was composed after C.36 but before C.37. The slash numbers tell the point of time related to the recent compositions that the version of the piece was arranged. For example, C.58/96b is a piece, originally composed as C.58, that was arranged after C.96 was composed and C.96a was composed/arranged but before C.97 was composed. These two cases are not really common actually because most of the time I don't forget to assign composition numbers and usually use the original version for release (but there's a bunch of them in Opus 6).</p>

            <h1 class="sec-head">About me as a composer</h1>
            <div class="yap">
                <p>Hi, I am IcyAlmondEarth, or sometimes IcyAlmondE depends on which platform I appear on. I am a young amateur pianist from Thailand who has a passion to compose music. I am currently a first year computer engineering undergraduate student, but I still find some time for piano and composing. I have been playing the piano since I was 4 years old (average asian kid but unfortunately I am not a child prodigy) and composed my first piece in 2015 (I guess?), which was only 8 bars long. I was not really serious about it at that time, until my final times of elementary middle school, I started playing Piano Tiles 2 which unexpectedly lead me to my journey with classical music.</p>
                <p>My interest in classical music grew over time, giving me the urge to be like the classical composers, but it was not really a significant one. After getting in middle school, I had more time with music and explored the music of Frederic Chopin. His pieces became my favorite style of music as I started playing them. And Covid-19 struck in, perfectly timed, giving me extra time with the piano. I explored a wider range of pieces and started to think that it would be nice if I could make music like the famous composers. That was when I decided to give a try on composing, taking the advantage of the quarantine time.</p>
                <p>At the end of 2020, I finally finished my second piece based on Chopin’s Nocturne Op.9 No.2. I found composing pretty fun and have been continuing since then. In my first year of composing, I relied only on a notation software, never really got my compositions played. After my first year of high school, I tried the traditional way of composing; actually playing on the piano and writing the notes down (on an iPad but anyways). And the Opus 1 and Opus 2 was created; four consecutive pieces written by hand on my iPad during the summer break and the first semester of my second year of high school.</p>
                <p>Being in an engineering-based high school gave me an opportunity to initiate and create a lot of stuff. One day, I was asked by my senior about why I want to be an engineer. I spent some time with that question and came up with “I want to create something of myself, so people will remember me.” as the answer. That made me realize that I had been following something all along. A dream, a dream to be remembered and recorded in the history. I decided to rely on music for that dream, building my identity from my compositions.</p>
                <p>That’s why I am here, playing the piano and composing music. Not for anyone, but for myself, happily.</p>
